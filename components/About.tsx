                  Established in 2022, EduSling is an upcoming startup that aims to spread the passion of learning to
                  everyone. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to excel in their education, and we
                  want to make that happen. We are a free service for all students, young and old, and we pride ourselves
                  on our mission to make education a right, not a privilege.
